            Hi, I'm T√°ssio Jord√£o (TJ), a Chemical with Front-End experience.
            Actually, I'm a Frontend developer with some Chemistry knowledge. That
            decision (changing from chemistry to coding) was in 2018 when I had
            contact with VBA (programming language) in an old professional
            experience - for those who don't know VBA is to do automatic tasks in
            Excel - , at that moment I noticed as I love coding. After talking with
            some friends from this area, I decided to become a Front End developer.
            It was in 2019 January. And, after 6 months of studying hard, I got my
            first opportunity on a website about recipes. It was an awesome
            achievement and fired up me to keep in this new area.`,
          action: {
            title: 'Keep reading',
            link: '/about',

                There is more than one reason why I have created this website.
                I can say I did it to share my knowledge as a developer.
                To practice English, once I'll create posts in that language.
                To build a system end-to-end.
                I mean, as a developer, it's awesome to have your project.
                Taking care of it and see it growing up, facing the challenge of keeping it scalable,
                 and see how you have been improving since it has started.
                So, that is a good tip for you.
                Try to get an opportunity, or necessity, of learning something new and put it practice with other stuff that would be nice if you have known.
