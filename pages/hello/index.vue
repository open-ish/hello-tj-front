        Hi, I'm a Chemical with Front-End experience üòÅ Actually, I'm a Frontend
        developer with some Chemistry knowledge. That decision (changing from
        chemistry to coding) was in 2018 when I had contact with VBA
        (programming language) in an old professional experience - for those who
        don't know VBA is to do automatic tasks in Excel, at that moment I
        noticed as I love coding. After talking with some friends from this
        area, I decided to become a Front End developer. It was in 2019 January.
        And, after 6 months of studying hard, I got my first opportunity on a
        website about recipes. It was an awesome achievement and fired up me to
        keep in this new area. I have been working in a new amazing company
        since 2020, as a Front End developer too.
